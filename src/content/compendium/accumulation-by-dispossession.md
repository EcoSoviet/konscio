## What Is Accumulation by Dispossession?

Accumulation by dispossession describes how wealth is generated through the seizure of common land, privatisation of public goods, extraction of natural resources, and the erosion of communal rights. It is the modern continuation of historical enclosure.

## Historical Context

While Marx wrote about “primitive accumulation,” contemporary theorist David Harvey expanded the idea to explain how neoliberal capitalism relies on continuous rounds of dispossession to stay profitable.

## Key Principles

- **Privatisation of public assets**
- **Resource grabs by corporations**
- **Land dispossession of rural and Indigenous communities**
- **Debt as a tool for extracting wealth**
- **Extraction enforced by law, policing, or military power**

## Modern Examples

- Land grabs for industrial agriculture or mining
- Water privatisation and control by multinational firms
- Housing speculation displacing urban communities
- Forced removals for infrastructure megaprojects

## Relationship to Eco-Socialism

Eco-socialism challenges dispossession by prioritising land sovereignty, community ownership, and ecological restoration. It connects directly to [extractivism](/compendium/extractivism) and [decolonisation](/compendium/decolonisation). It also confronts [capitalism](/compendium/capitalism) where profit depends on enclosure and privatisation.
