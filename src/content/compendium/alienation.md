## What Is Alienation?

Alienation describes the condition in which workers lose control over their work and its products. Instead of shaping their world, they become tools within someone else’s pursuit of profit. This affects not only material life but also emotional, social, and creative well-being.

## Historical Context

Karl Marx analysed alienation in early industrial capitalism, showing how wage labour forces people to surrender creative control and autonomy. Later socialist thinkers extended the idea to modern workplaces, consumer culture, and technological systems.

## Key Principles

- Loss of control over the work process
- Separation from the product of labour
- Fragmented social relations
- Diminished capacity for self-realisation

## Modern Examples

- Highly surveilled workplaces
- Gig platforms dictating pace and terms of labour
- Commodity culture replacing community ties
- Burnout in service and tech professions

## Relationship to Socialism

[Socialism](/compendium/socialism) aims to remove alienation by democratising production and giving workers collective control over their labour. By transforming the [means of production](/compendium/means-of-production) and ending [surplus value](/compendium/surplus-value) extraction, socialism restores meaning and autonomy to work.
