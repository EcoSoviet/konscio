## What Are the Base and Superstructure?

The **base** refers to the economic system: productive forces, labour relations, land, and technology. The **superstructure** refers to institutions built on that foundation: law, culture, ideology, education, religion, and the state.

The base creates conditions for the superstructure, and the superstructure stabilises and legitimises the base.

## Historical Context

Marx introduced the model to explain why societies reproduce certain systems even when they are unjust. The institutions of the superstructure maintain existing power relations because they serve the interests tied to the base.

## Key Principles

- **Economic foundations shape ideology**
- **Institutions reinforce dominant class power**
- **Change in the base transforms the superstructure**
- **Superstructure can influence but not override economic conditions**

## Modern Examples

- Media systems owned by corporate interests shaping public opinion, reinforcing [hegemony](/compendium/hegemony)
- Legal systems designed to protect [private property](/compendium/private-property)
- Education systems preparing people for wage labour
- Cultural narratives that normalise consumerism

## Relationship to Socialism

Understanding base and superstructure clarifies why systems like [neocolonialism](/compendium/neocolonialism) and [capitalism](/compendium/capitalism) reproduce themselves and how transformation depends on reorganising the base itself. It connects to how the [state](/compendium/the-state) and law stabilise property relations.
