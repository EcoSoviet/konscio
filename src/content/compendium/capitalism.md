## What Is Capitalism?

Capitalism is a system where most productive assets – land, factories, energy systems, logistics, and major industries – are privately owned and operated for profit. People without property must sell their labour to survive, creating a divide between owners and workers.

## Historical Context

Capitalism emerged in Europe through processes like enclosure, colonial expansion, and the rise of wage labour. These developments created markets, dispossessed rural populations, and linked global economies through extraction and trade.
These histories tie directly to [imperialism](/compendium/imperialism) and contemporary [neocolonialism](/compendium/neocolonialism).

## Key Principles

- **Private ownership of productive assets**
- **Wage labour as the basis of survival**
- **Production for profit rather than need**
- **Competition between firms**
- **Endless expansion and accumulation**

## Modern Examples

- Fossil fuel conglomerates driving ecological collapse
- Tech monopolies extracting user data for profit
- Landlords accumulating wealth through rising rents
- Financial institutions shaping global policy through debt
  These dynamics often depend on [accumulation by dispossession](/compendium/accumulation-by-dispossession).

## Relationship to Socialism

Capitalism stands in direct contradiction to [socialism](/compendium/socialism), which aims to replace exploitation with democratic control and collective ownership. It is central to concepts like [surplus-value](/compendium/surplus-value), [imperialism](/compendium/imperialism), and [commodity-fetishism](/compendium/commodity-fetishism).
