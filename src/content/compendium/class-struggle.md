## What Is Class Struggle?

Class struggle is the tension and conflict between groups with different relations to the economy. In socialist analysis, the key divide is between those who own the productive assets of society and those who must sell their labour to survive. This struggle is not only economic. It shapes politics, culture, and the organisation of daily life.

## Historical Context

Karl Marx identified class struggle as the driving force of historical change. Societies move through stages based on how production is organised and who controls it. Feudalism, slavery, capitalism, and future forms all rest on competing class interests.

Working class movements, peasant uprisings, anti-colonial liberation struggles, and socialist revolutions all express class struggle in different forms. Many of these emerge from conflicts over [capitalism](/compendium/capitalism) and the organisation of the [means of production](/compendium/means-of-production).

## Key Principles

- **Opposing interests**. Owners seek profit and control, workers seek fair compensation and autonomy.
- **Structural conflict**. The struggle is built into the economic system, not caused by personal feelings.
- **Collective action**. Strikes, unions, cooperatives, and political parties are tools for class power.
- **Historical movement**. Class struggle transforms institutions, laws, and social norms.

## Modern Examples

- Union campaigns for fair wages and safe workplaces
- Tenant movements challenging rent extraction
- Workers forming cooperatives when factories close
- Conflicts over mining, land rights, and environmental destruction

## Relationship to Socialism

Socialism views class struggle as the path toward a system where the [means of production](/compendium/means-of-production) are democratically controlled. It connects directly to concepts like [surplus-value](/compendium/surplus-value) and [imperialism](/compendium/imperialism).
