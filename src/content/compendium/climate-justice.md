## What Is Climate Justice?

Climate justice argues that those least responsible for emissions face the greatest consequences. It demands that climate policy address structural inequality, not just carbon metrics.

## Historical Context

Rooted in environmental justice movements, Indigenous resistance, and Global South activism, climate justice gained prominence as climate negotiations failed to address historical responsibility.

## Key Principles

- Fair distribution of climate impacts and responsibilities
- Protection of frontline communities
- Reparative finance for the Global South
- Democratic control of energy and land

## Modern Examples

- Loss and damage campaigns
- Indigenous-led land defense
- Youth climate strikes
- Anti-extraction movements
- Demands for climate finance and debt cancellation

## Relationship to Eco-Socialism

Climate justice complements [eco-socialism](/compendium/eco-socialism) by centring power, inequality, and historical exploitation. It connects to [decolonisation](/compendium/decolonisation) through demands for reparations, rejects [extractivism](/compendium/extractivism), and advocates for a [just transition](/compendium/just-transition) that protects frontline communities.
