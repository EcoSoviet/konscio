## What Is Commodity Fetishism?

Commodity fetishism describes how commodities appear as independent objects with value of their own, hiding the labour and social relations that produced them. This creates a distorted view of the economy where relationships between people are replaced by relationships between things.

## Historical Context

Marx introduced the idea to show how capitalism obscures exploitation. Instead of seeing human labour behind products, consumers see price tags, brands, and abstract market forces.

## Key Principles

- **Labour becomes invisible**
- **Objects appear to have intrinsic value**
- **Social and ecological costs are hidden**
- **Market relations substitute for human relations**

## Modern Examples

- Smartphones whose supply chains hide mining exploitation, a pattern of [extractivism](/compendium/extractivism)
- Clothing that conceals sweatshop labour
- Food systems that mask land theft and ecological harm
- Digital products that obscure the workers behind platforms

## Relationship to Socialism

Socialism seeks to expose and overcome this distortion by democratising the [means of production](/compendium/means-of-production) and reconnecting social life with the labour and ecosystems that sustain it, challenging [capitalism](/compendium/capitalism) where objects appear to have intrinsic value.
