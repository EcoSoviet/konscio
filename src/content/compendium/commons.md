## What Are the Commons?

The commons include land, water, forests, digital spaces, and knowledge systems that communities manage collectively. The focus is on shared responsibility and long-term sustainability instead of individual ownership or corporate extraction.

## Historical Context

Traditional commons existed across Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Americas until enclosure and colonisation restricted communal access. Modern commons movements revive these practices in ecological, urban, and digital contexts.

## Key Principles

- Shared access and stewardship
- Collective decision-making
- Long-term ecological responsibility
- Resistance to enclosure and privatisation

## Modern Examples

- Community land trusts
- Water commons managed by local councils
- Open-source software
- Seed-sharing networks
- Cooperative forests and fisheries

## Relationship to Eco-Socialism

The commons model aligns with [eco-socialism](/compendium/eco-socialism) by grounding resource management in care, democracy, and ecological limits. It challenges [private property](/compendium/private-property) and offers an alternative to both market extraction and centralized state control, linking to broader forms of [social ownership](/compendium/social-ownership).
