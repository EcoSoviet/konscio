## What Is Communism?

Communism describes a society where class divisions, exploitation, and private ownership of the means of production have been abolished. Production is organised collectively, and distribution is based on need rather than profit.

## Historical Context

Karl Marx saw communism as a future stage that emerges after capitalism and socialism. Various movements claimed the term in the 20th century, though many states used it to describe systems that were transitional rather than fully communist.

## Key Principles

- No private ownership of productive assets
- No class hierarchy
- Distribution by need, not wage relation
- Collective decision-making
- Human development as the main goal of society

## Common Misunderstandings

Communism is often equated with authoritarian state rule. In theory, communism involves the opposite: the absence of a coercive state and the full democratisation of social life.

## Relationship to Eco-Socialism

Communism aligns with ecological goals by rejecting growth-driven competition and centring cooperative stewardship of land and resources. It represents the furthest development of [socialism](/compendium/socialism), where [private property](/compendium/private-property) in the [means of production](/compendium/means-of-production) has been fully abolished and replaced with collective coordination. It stands in contrast to [capitalism](/compendium/capitalism), which prioritises profit and accumulation over human need.
