## What Is Decolonisation?

Decolonisation is more than the end of formal rule. It involves transforming the political, economic, and cultural systems that continue to reproduce colonial power. This includes reclaiming land, reshaping institutions, and restoring Indigenous sovereignty.

## Historical Context

Political independence across Africa, Asia, and Latin America did not dissolve extractive structures. Neocolonial practices persisted through trade, finance, and resource control, requiring deeper movements for decolonial change.

## Key Principles

- Restoration of land and autonomy
- Challenge to extractive and racialised structures
- Recognition of Indigenous governance
- Rebuilding economies beyond colonial patterns

## Modern Examples

- Land rights movements
- Resistance to extractive mega-projects
- Cultural revitalisation projects
- Demands for reparations and ecological restoration

## Relationship to Eco-Socialism

[Eco-socialism](/compendium/eco-socialism) identifies colonial extraction as a driver of climate breakdown, making decolonisation essential for ecological justice. It challenges ongoing [neocolonialism](/compendium/neocolonialism), [imperialism](/compendium/imperialism), and [extractivism](/compendium/extractivism), connecting to [climate justice](/compendium/climate-justice) demands for reparations and sovereignty.
