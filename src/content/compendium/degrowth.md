## What Is Degrowth?

Degrowth challenges the idea that endless economic expansion is desirable or sustainable. It argues that high-consuming economies must scale down resource use while improving quality of life through public goods, shorter work hours, and collective provisioning.

## Historical Context

Initially a critique of ecological economics, degrowth has grown into a broad movement with roots in environmentalism, anti-colonial struggles, and post-growth economic theory.

## Key Principles

- Reduction of unnecessary production
- Prioritising well-being over GDP
- Strengthening public services
- Shifting from consumerism to sufficiency
- Ecological repair

## Modern Examples

- Car-free city planning
- Workweek reduction campaigns
- Community repair workshops
- Agricultural systems based on agroecology

## Relationship to Eco-Socialism

Degrowth overlaps with [eco-socialism](/compendium/eco-socialism) in rejecting extraction and corporate-driven expansion while emphasising material sufficiency and democratic planning. It strengthens [public goods](/compendium/public-goods) and collective provisioning, aligning with [climate justice](/compendium/climate-justice) movements for equitable resource distribution.
