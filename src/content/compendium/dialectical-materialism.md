## What Is Dialectical Materialism?

Dialectical materialism is a method for analysing how change happens. It argues that everything is shaped by tensions and contradictions between different forces. These contradictions push systems to evolve, collapse, or transform.

## Historical Context

Marx and Engels drew from earlier dialectical philosophy but grounded it in material reality. Instead of abstract ideas clashing in pure thought, they focused on real contradictions in economic and social life.

## Key Principles

- **Everything changes**. Social systems are dynamic, not fixed.
- **Contradiction is central**. Competing forces exist within the same system.
- **Quantitative change becomes qualitative change**. Small shifts accumulate until a system transforms.
- **Unity of opposites**. Conflicting forces depend on each other even as they clash.

## Modern Examples

- Tension between profit and ecological survival, a core concern of [climate justice](/compendium/climate-justice)
- Conflicts between corporate power and worker rights
- Expanding productive forces within restrictive [capitalist](/compendium/capitalism) relations

## Relationship to Other Concepts

Dialectical materialism complements [historical materialism](/compendium/historical-materialism). It informs how we understand [class struggle](/compendium/class-struggle) and structural change in political economy.
