## What Is Eco-Socialism?

Eco-socialism holds that ecological survival and human liberation require dismantling the economic logic that treats nature and labour as expendable. It links climate breakdown, inequality, and colonial extraction into one system.

## Historical Context

Eco-socialism gained prominence in the late 20th century as ecological science and socialist analysis converged. Movements in Latin America, Africa, and Europe expanded it through land struggles, climate justice campaigns, and Indigenous knowledge.

## Key Principles

- Collective and democratic ownership of energy and land
- Ecological limits as non-negotiable
- A rapid transition away from fossil fuels
- Repair and redistribution instead of extraction
- Community power over resource decisions

## Modern Expressions

- Community-owned renewable energy
- Land reform and agroecology
- Climate justice movements
- Public green infrastructure
- Regional industrial policies that reduce extraction

## Relationship to Socialism

Eco-socialism argues that [socialism](/compendium/socialism) without ecological limits risks repeating industrial destruction, and ecological politics without socialism cannot confront capital. It rejects [extractivism](/compendium/extractivism), advances [climate justice](/compendium/climate-justice) and [just transition](/compendium/just-transition) demands, supports [decolonisation](/compendium/decolonisation), and requires [social ownership](/compendium/social-ownership) of energy and land.
