## What Is Extractivism?

Extractivism prioritises the large-scale extraction of minerals, fossil fuels, timber, and other resources for external markets. It concentrates wealth while leaving ecological damage and poverty in extraction zones.

## Historical Context

Colonialism entrenched extractive economies across the Global South. Contemporary versions persist through corporate concessions, foreign investment, and unequal trade structures.

## Key Principles

- Resource removal for external benefit
- Displacement of communities
- Ecological degradation
- Concentration of power in corporations and states

## Modern Examples

- Cobalt and copper mining in Congo
- Oil extraction in the Niger Delta
- Amazon deforestation for agribusiness
- Coal and gas expansion worldwide

## Relationship to Eco-Socialism

[Eco-socialism](/compendium/eco-socialism) rejects extractivism and promotes democratic control of land, reparative justice, and ecological restoration. Extractivism is driven by [imperialism](/compendium/imperialism) and [neocolonialism](/compendium/neocolonialism), making [decolonisation](/compendium/decolonisation) and [climate justice](/compendium/climate-justice) central to ending it.
