## What Is Hegemony?

Hegemony refers to the cultural and ideological leadership of a dominant class. Instead of ruling only through force, ruling groups gain consent by shaping norms, beliefs, and everyday assumptions. This makes their power seem normal and inevitable.

## Historical Context

Italian theorist Antonio Gramsci developed the concept while analysing why capitalism persisted despite mass inequality. He argued that cultural institutions play a central role in producing consent for ruling class interests.

## Key Principles

- **Power through consent, not only coercion**
- **Cultural leadership by dominant classes**
- **Norms presented as natural or common sense**
- **Counter hegemony as resistance**

## Modern Examples

- Media normalising corporate power, reinforcing [commodity fetishism](/compendium/commodity-fetishism)
- Advertising encouraging endless consumption
- Political narratives that portray inequality as meritocratic
- NGOs promoting soft forms of [neocolonialism](/compendium/neocolonialism) policy

## Relationship to Socialism

Gramsci’s insight explains why material exploitation persists even when people oppose its outcomes. It complements concepts like [alienation](/compendium/alienation) and [commodity-fetishism](/compendium/commodity-fetishism).
