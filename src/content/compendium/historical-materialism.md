## What Is Historical Materialism?

Historical materialism is the idea that the organisation of material life shapes the development of society. How people produce food, goods, and services influences their relationships, institutions, and beliefs. It provides a framework for explaining why societies change over time.

## Historical Context

Developed by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, historical materialism challenged explanations of history that focused only on ideals, heroes, or accidents. Instead, it examined the economic foundations of society as the main driver of social transformation.

## Key Principles

- **Material foundations shape society**. Economic systems influence law, politics, ideology, and culture.
- **Production determines class structure**. The organisation of labour creates classes with different interests.
- **Contradictions drive change**. When productive forces outgrow old systems, conflict emerges.
- **Historical stages**. Societies move through modes of production shaped by [class struggle](/compendium/class-struggle).

## Modern Examples

- How industrialisation transformed family structures and urban life
- How fossil fuel economies created new political institutions
- How colonial extraction shaped global inequality under [imperialism](/compendium/imperialism)

## Relationship to Other Concepts

Historical materialism underpins ideas like [base and superstructure](/compendium/base-and-superstructure), [class struggle](/compendium/class-struggle), and [dialectical materialism](/compendium/dialectical-materialism).
