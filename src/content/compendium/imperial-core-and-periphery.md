## What Is the Imperial Core?

The imperial core refers to powerful states that dominate global trade, finance, military structures, and political norms. These states extract value from the global periphery and shape global systems in their favour.

## What Is the Periphery?

The periphery includes countries whose economies are structured around exporting raw materials, cheap labour, or strategic resources to the core. They experience weaker bargaining power, unequal exchange, and political dependency.

## Historical Context

The core–periphery divide emerged through colonialism and intensified under modern global capitalism. Even after decolonisation, structures of [neocolonialism](/compendium/neocolonialism) maintained unequal flows of value.

## Key Principles

- **Unequal exchange of goods and labour**
- **Extraction of raw materials for low returns**
- **Debt dependency and structural adjustment**
- **Military and political influence from the core**

## Modern Examples

- Africa supplying minerals for tech and renewable energy industries
- Latin America exporting agricultural commodities under corporate control
- Global South populations bearing the brunt of climate impacts

## Relationship to Eco-Socialism

Understanding the core–periphery divide is essential for analysing extractivism, [climate justice](/compendium/climate-justice), and global inequality. It clarifies how [imperialism](/compendium/imperialism) organises global power and resources.
