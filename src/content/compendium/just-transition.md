## What Is a Just Transition?

A just transition ensures that the move to a low-carbon economy does not leave workers or communities behind. It links climate policy with social protection, job guarantees, and democratic planning.

## Historical Context

The term emerged from labour movements demanding fairness as industries changed. It expanded through climate justice movements, unions, and frontline communities.

## Key Principles

- Protecting workers in affected industries
- Investing in new livelihoods
- Community-led decision-making
- Ecological restoration
- Universal access to public services

## Modern Examples

- Coal region transition plans
- Public renewable energy projects
- Green job guarantees
- Community-driven adaptation programs

## Relationship to Eco-Socialism

[Eco-socialism](/compendium/eco-socialism) views just transition as essential for ending fossil dependence without reproducing inequality. It links [climate justice](/compendium/climate-justice) demands with expanded [public goods](/compendium/public-goods) and [social ownership](/compendium/social-ownership) of energy systems to ensure workers and communities shape the transition.
