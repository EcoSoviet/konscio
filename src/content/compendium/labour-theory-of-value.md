## What Is the Labour Theory of Value?

The labour theory of value argues that the value of a commodity is determined by the socially necessary labour time required to produce it. Workers create value through their labour, while owners extract profit by appropriating part of this value.

## Historical Context

Developed by classical economists like Adam Smith and David Ricardo, the theory was transformed by Marx to reveal how exploitation works under capitalism: workers produce more value than they receive in wages, generating [surplus-value](/compendium/surplus-value).

## Key Principles

- **Labour is the source of value**
- **Wages cover only part of the value workers create**
- **Profit depends on unpaid labour time**
- **Competition pushes firms to intensify labour exploitation**

## Modern Examples

- Warehouse workers producing far more value than their hourly rate
- Agricultural labour generating profit for global supply chains
- Software engineers whose intellectual output becomes corporate property

## Relationship to Socialism

The labour theory of value explains the root of exploitation and supports the socialist argument for collective control over the [means of production](/compendium/means-of-production).
