## What Are the Means of Production?

The means of production include factories, farms, mines, energy systems, logistics networks, and the technologies used to create goods and services. Whoever controls them holds power over economic life.

## Historical Context

Marx identified control of the means of production as the foundation of class structure. Capitalism centralises ownership in private hands, creating a divide between owners and workers.

## Key Principles

- Ownership shapes class relations
- Control determines how society's wealth is produced
- Exploitation arises when workers do not control the tools they use

## Modern Examples

- Corporate-controlled energy grids
- Large agribusiness plantations
- Automated logistics systems
- Mining and extraction infrastructure

## Relationship to Socialism

[Socialism](/compendium/socialism) seeks collective, democratic control of the means of production to eliminate exploitation and align production with human need. This involves ending [private property](/compendium/private-property) in major industries, establishing [social ownership](/compendium/social-ownership), removing [alienation](/compendium/alienation), and stopping [surplus value](/compendium/surplus-value) extraction.
