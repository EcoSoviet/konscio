## What Is Mutual Aid?

Mutual aid is collective action where communities organise to meet each other’s needs directly. It rejects the giver–receiver hierarchy common in charity and treats everyone as both contributor and participant.

## Historical Context

The concept was theorised by Peter Kropotkin, who argued that cooperation is central to human survival. Mutual aid has deep roots in Indigenous, working-class, and anti-colonial traditions.

## Key Principles

- Solidarity, not charity
- Horizontal decision-making
- Direct support for immediate needs
- Collective empowerment

## Modern Examples

- Community fridges and free food networks
- Tenant support groups
- Neighbourhood disaster response
- Time banks and skill-sharing networks
- Childcare or elder care cooperatives

## Relationship to Eco-Socialism

Mutual aid prefigures an economy based on cooperation and shared responsibility rather than market exchange. It embodies principles central to [socialism](/compendium/socialism) and aligns with [commons](/compendium/commons)-based approaches to collective provisioning and care.
