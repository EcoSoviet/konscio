## What Is Neocolonialism?

Neocolonialism replaces direct rule with financial dependence, unfair contracts, multinational corporate power, and political influence that limits sovereignty.

## Historical Context

After formal independence, many countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America remained tied to colonial patterns of trade, extraction, and foreign ownership.

## Key Principles

- Economic dependency despite formal independence
- Control through loans, debt, and trade
- Foreign ownership of land and resources
- Weak bargaining power for the Global South

## Modern Examples

- Cobalt supply chains in Congo
- IMF conditionalities
- Foreign agribusiness land grabs
- Security partnerships tied to resource deals

## Relationship to Eco-Socialism

[Eco-socialism](/compendium/eco-socialism) identifies neocolonialism as a central barrier to democratic, ecological development. It perpetuates [imperialism](/compendium/imperialism) through economic means, drives [extractivism](/compendium/extractivism), and requires [decolonisation](/compendium/decolonisation) to dismantle its structures.
