## What Is Private Property?

In socialist theory, private property refers specifically to assets used to extract profit: factories, mines, large landholdings, corporate infrastructure, and major industries. It is not the same as personal belongings.

## Historical Context

The distinction between personal and private property dates back to early socialist thinkers and was sharpened by Marx, who argued that private ownership of production concentrates economic power and creates class division.

## Key Principles

- Ownership enables exploitation
- Private property reproduces inequality
- Concentrated control over essential systems undermines democracy

## Common Confusion

Private property is often conflated with homes or personal items. Socialism challenges profit-making property, not personal possessions.

## Relationship to Socialism

A [socialist](/compendium/socialism) system replaces private property in major industries with collective, public, or cooperative ownership. This transforms the [means of production](/compendium/means-of-production) through [social ownership](/compendium/social-ownership) and [commons](/compendium/commons)-based governance.
