## What Are Public Goods?

Public goods include essentials like water, healthcare, transport, and education. They are systems that should not depend on ability to pay but should be guaranteed as rights through collective provisioning.

## Historical Context

Public goods expanded globally in the 20th century through labour movements and social democratic reforms. Later neoliberal waves undermined many such systems through privatisation and cost-cutting.

## Key Principles

- Universal access
- Provision based on need
- Democratic and accountable management
- Protection from profit extraction

## Modern Examples

- Public health systems
- Social housing
- National parks and protected ecosystems
- Public transport networks

## Relationship to Socialism

[Socialism](/compendium/socialism) treats public goods as core infrastructure for freedom, allowing people to live dignified lives without market coercion. They are maintained through [social ownership](/compendium/social-ownership) and strengthened by [degrowth](/compendium/degrowth) approaches that prioritise collective provisioning over private consumption.
