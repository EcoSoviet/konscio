## What Is Reification?

Reification describes a form of alienation where human-made systems come to feel natural, fixed, or beyond human control. Social relationships are treated as things rather than collective processes.

## Historical Context

Developed by Marxist theorist Georg Lukács, reification highlights how capitalism turns dynamic human relations into rigid structures. Markets, institutions, or technologies seem to operate autonomously, even though humans created them.
This process intensifies [alienation](/compendium/alienation) under [capitalism](/compendium/capitalism).

## Key Principles

- **Human actions appear as independent forces**
- **Systems seem natural rather than constructed**
- **People relate to social structures as objects**
- **Critical thought becomes difficult**

## Modern Examples

- Markets seen as natural laws rather than political choices
- Algorithms treated as objective authorities
- Jobs described as “created” by capital rather than workers
- The economy treated as more important than human life

## Relationship to Alienation

Reification is a deeper expression of [alienation](/compendium/alienation), where human creativity and agency are obscured by the systems people themselves reproduce.
