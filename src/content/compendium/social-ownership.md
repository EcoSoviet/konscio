## What Is Social Ownership?

Social ownership means that essential systems – energy, housing, transport, land, major industries – are controlled by society as a whole. Control can be exercised through public institutions, cooperatives, communities, or mixed democratic structures.

## Historical Context

Social ownership emerged from workers’ struggles against private capital. Different models developed across countries: public utilities, cooperatives, municipal ownership, and community land trusts.

## Key Principles

- Democratic governance
- Accountability to the public
- Redistribution of power
- Production for need, not profit

## Modern Examples

- Public transit systems
- Worker-owned factories
- Community-owned renewable energy
- Social housing associations
- Municipal water and energy utilities

## Relationship to Eco-Socialism

Social ownership enables planned, equitable ecological transitions and reduces corporate control over extraction and energy. It is central to [socialism](/compendium/socialism) and [eco-socialism](/compendium/eco-socialism), transforming the [means of production](/compendium/means-of-production) by replacing [private property](/compendium/private-property) with democratic structures like [commons](/compendium/commons) and cooperatives.
