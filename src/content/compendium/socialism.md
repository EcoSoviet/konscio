## What Is Socialism?

Socialism is a system where the core institutions that shape survival – energy, land, housing, transport, major industries – are governed for public benefit rather than private profit. It argues that democracy is incomplete if it stops at the voting booth and excludes the economy.

## Historical Context

Emerging in the 19th century as a response to industrial capitalism, socialism developed through workers’ movements, cooperatives, and political parties. Marx and Engels provided a structural analysis of capital, while later traditions adapted socialism to different contexts and struggles.

## Key Principles

- Democratic control of the economy
- Collective ownership of major resources
- An end to exploitation and surplus extraction
- Universal social guarantees
- Economic planning grounded in human need

## Modern Expressions

- Public utilities and services
- Worker cooperatives
- Social housing systems
- Universal healthcare and education
- Democratic socialist governments at municipal or national levels

## Relationship to Eco-Socialism

[Eco-socialism](/compendium/eco-socialism) expands socialism by recognising ecological limits. It insists that a system based on endless growth cannot be reconciled with a liveable planet. Socialism establishes [social ownership](/compendium/social-ownership) of the [means of production](/compendium/means-of-production), eliminates [alienation](/compendium/alienation) and [surplus value](/compendium/surplus-value) extraction, and strengthens [public goods](/compendium/public-goods).
