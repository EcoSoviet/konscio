## What Is Surplus Value?

Surplus value is the difference between what workers produce and what they are paid. Under capitalism, this surplus is captured by the owner or corporation, forming the foundation of profit. It explains how exploitation occurs even when wages appear fair.

## Historical Context

Marx introduced surplus value to reveal the internal mechanics of capitalism. Instead of profit arising from clever trade or innovation, he argued it comes from unpaid labour.

## Key Principles

- Workers produce more value than they receive
- Owners capture the surplus
- Profit depends on exploitation
- Competition pushes firms to intensify labour extraction

## Modern Examples

- Warehouses with high quotas
- Tech workers creating intellectual property owned by their employer
- Agricultural labour producing surplus for large distributors

## Relationship to Socialism

A [socialist](/compendium/socialism) system eliminates surplus extraction by democratising ownership and distributing the value workers create. By transforming the [means of production](/compendium/means-of-production), it removes the structural basis for exploitation and [alienation](/compendium/alienation).
