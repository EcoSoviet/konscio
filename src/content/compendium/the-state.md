## What Is the State?

The state is a collection of institutions including the government, legal system, police, military, bureaucracy, and public administration. It manages political authority, enforces laws, and maintains social order.

## Historical Context

Marxist theory views the state as shaped by the economic base of society. Under capitalism, it tends to protect private property and stabilise conditions for accumulation. Socialists debate the role of the state in transitioning toward a more democratic and egalitarian society.
This connects to the relationship between [base and superstructure](/compendium/base-and-superstructure), where institutions stabilise the economic order.

## Key Principles

- **Instrument of class power**
- **Mediator of social conflict**
- **Provider of public goods and administration**
- **Enforcer of property relations**

## Modern Examples

- States subsidising fossil fuel companies
- Police protecting corporate assets during protests
- Public infrastructure managed through public institutions
- Welfare systems that support social needs but operate within capitalist constraints

## Relationship to Socialism

Socialists debate whether the state must be transformed, democratised, or replaced by new forms of collective governance like councils or assemblies. It links closely to [social ownership](/compendium/social-ownership).
It also mediates conflicts arising from [class struggle](/compendium/class-struggle).
