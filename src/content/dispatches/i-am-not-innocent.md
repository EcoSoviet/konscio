I was born into a system that worked for me before I understood what it was.

I did not choose to be white or Afrikaans. I did not choose the land distribution, the language hierarchy, the schooling, or the economic insulation that shaped my life. But none of that makes me innocent. Innocence is a story beneficiaries tell themselves to avoid responsibility.

South Africa is not “post” anything. Apartheid ended as law, not as structure. Colonialism did not leave. It adjusted, privatised, and learned to speak the language of markets. If you are white here, you live inside that continuity whether you acknowledge it or not.

I am a leftist because reality makes neutrality dishonest.

## Inheritance Is Not Neutral

Afrikaans is my first language. It holds intimacy and memory. It also carries command, bureaucracy, and the violence of apartheid administration. I do not get to separate what I love from what the language was used to enforce. Anyone who insists on that separation is protecting themselves.

White Afrikaners are skilled at narrating their own suffering. The Anglo-Boer War. British camps. Cultural marginalisation. There is always a story ready that recentres white pain. What is spoken less plainly is this: Afrikaner survival and prosperity were secured through Black dispossession. Our safety was engineered. Our wealth was structured. Our culture was defended by law and force.

Those advantages did not dissolve in 1994. They settled into property ownership, educational access, professional networks, and accumulated capital. These are not personal achievements. They are inherited conditions that continue to shape who is secure and who is exposed.

Naming this is not self-hatred. It is basic honesty.

## Racism Learned New Manners

Racism among white South Africans did not end with apartheid. It became quieter.

It lives in private conversations, in jokes framed as concern, in crime panic, in nostalgia for “standards”, in contempt for the poor, in endless talk about corruption that never reaches land theft or capital flight. It lives in the assumption that Black governance is inherently suspect while white management is naturally competent.

This is not confusion. It is interest.

The most effective racism now presents itself as neutrality. It condemns apartheid while opposing every material step required to undo its outcomes. It wants reconciliation without redistribution. It wants equality of language and symbolism, not equality of land, wealth, or power.

That position is not moderate. It is protective.

## Politics Without Redemption

I am an eco-socialist. That does not make me morally superior. It makes me unwilling to lie.

Capitalism in South Africa is inseparable from colonial extraction. A greener version of the same system does not change that. Decolonisation is not symbolic. It is material. Land ownership, energy systems, water, housing, and industry must move under democratic control. Repair must replace charity. Capital must lose privileges it has treated as natural.

Some people will lose power so others can live with dignity. If that produces discomfort among white people, that discomfort is irrelevant compared to the harm the present system continues to produce.

My politics are not about saving anyone. They are about refusing to defend a system that keeps me relatively safe by rendering others expendable.

## Responsibility Is Not Performance

There is a temptation for white leftists to turn guilt into spectacle. Endless confession. Loud self-critique. Moral display that recentres whiteness yet again.

Responsibility is quieter and harder. It means relinquishing authority in movements, institutions, and narratives that are not mine to control. It means listening without steering. It means accepting that some spaces are not mine and should not be. It means supporting struggles led by people who do not need my approval.

Silence is collaboration.

Responsibility also means confronting white people directly. In families. In social spaces. In progressive circles that still recoil at redistribution. Politeness often functions as fear, and fear protects inherited advantage.

I cannot undo history. But I can refuse to benefit from its denial.

## Reconciliation Without Justice Failed

South Africa tried reconciliation without repair. The result is visible everywhere. Gated suburbs beside informal settlements. Private healthcare beside collapsing public hospitals. Green estates beside poisoned rivers. Extreme wealth beside managed desperation.

The country is told to be patient while land reform stalls and capital remains mobile. That patience is demanded only of the poor. Appeals to unity and social cohesion function as discipline when material inequality remains untouched.

If there is a future worth living in here, it will not come from appeals to conscience aimed at those who profit from the present. It will come from organised pressure, democratic control, and a willingness to break with myths that protect inherited power.

I am not writing to confess. I am not asking for absolution.

I am writing to be clear.

I am not neutral.
I am not innocent.
And I am not stepping away from the responsibility that comes with where I was born.
